# ModularPortfolio
a self making portfolio for game artist who don't know how to website

If you understand what JSONn or XMLHttpRequests are this is not for you, go build your own website. 
If you didn't understand those terms, this may be for you.

# How do I use this?
It's really not in a usable state currently but if you'd like to test it out:

1. download the zip or clone the git if you're a already familiar
2. drop your renders into the _img_ folder (should be larger than 800px, go big or go home)
3. edit the _website.content_ file with your information, only renders and soicial links atm
 ⋅⋅*(you can copy and paste the render entries as many times as you like, be careful with curly braces and commas)
4. if you don't have any mistakes your website now is now ready, upload and enjoy

# What's planned to come?
Currently planned features include:
* ~~Renders with a description~~ (tentative)
* ~~Social media links~~
* Personal / contact info
* Lightbox style gallery
* Printable version formatting
* Render breakdown sub page
* Videos/docs on how to use
* Different page style packs

# Why the hell are you doing this?!
a few reasons, the two main being:

firstly I love webdesign (even if it's not my strong suit) but I hate populating with content, my hope is once I have this framework set up adding content will be as painless as possible and thus making maintaining much easier but leaves editing the style/layout open to me to tinker with

and secondly I see a lot of student game artists with down right aweful portfolios (and not due to their content), reliance on free survices which are bloated and/or not suitable for presenting art in a simple and concise way. I mean for this project to produce something which is simple, which anyone could use by simply watching a 5 minute video tutorial, that gives them a simple portfolio which loads quickly and doesn't get in the way of people seeing their art.

I would love to hear any feedback you have for this project, my email is on my profile if you'd like to email me.
